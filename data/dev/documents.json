Blocks A  block  describes the meaning of a piece of data in the context of a learning task For example for supervised learning tasks there is an input block and a target block and we want to learn to predict targets from inputs Learning to predict a cat/dog label  Label([\"cat dog  from 2D images  Image{2  is a supervised image classification task A block is not a piece of data itself Instead it describes the meaning of a piece of data in a context That a piece of data is a block can be checked using  checkblock  block data  A piece of data for the  Label  block above needs to be one of the labels so  checkblock(Label([\"cat dog cat  true  but  checkblock(Label([\"cat dog cat  false  We can say that a data container is compatible with a learning task if every observation in it is a valid sample of the sample block of the learning task The sample block for supervised tasks is  sampleblock  inputblock targetblock  so  sample  getobs(data i  from a compatible data container implies that  checkblock(sampleblock sample  This also means that any data stored in blocks must not depend on individual samples we can store the names of possible classes inside the  Label  block because they are the same across the whole dataset Data pipelines We can use blocks to formalize the data processing pipeline During  training  we want to create pairs of data  x y  s.t  output  model(x  and  loss  lossfn(output y  In terms of blocks that means  model  is a function  x  output  and the loss function maps  outputblock yblock  loss  Usually  input target  x y  and instead we have an encoding step that transforms a sample into representations suitable to train a model on i.e  encode  sample  x y  For the above image classification example we have  sampleblock  Image{2 Label([\"cat dog  but we cannot put raw images into a model and get out a class Instead the image is converted to an array that includes the color dimension and its values are normalized and the class label is one-hot encoded So  xblock  ImageTensor{2  and  yblock  OneHotTensor{0  Hence to do training we need a sample encoding function  Image{2 Label  ImageTensor{2 OneHotTensor{0 During  inference  we have an input and want to use a trained model to predict a target i.e  input  target  The model is again a mapping  xblock  outputblock  so we can build the transformation with an encoding step that encodes the input and a decoding step that takes the model output back into a target This gives us predict  input  target  decodeoutput ∘ model ∘ encodeinput  where encodeinput  input  x model  x  y decodeoutput  y  target In the classification example we have written in blocks  predict  Image{2  Label  and hence  encodeinput  Image{2  ImageTensor{2  and  decodeoutput  OneHotTensor{0  Label Where do we draw the line between model and data processing In general the encoding and decoding steps are  non-learnable  transformations while the model is a  learnable  transformation Encodings Encodings  are reversible transformations that model the non-learnable parts encoding and decoding of the data pipeline What an encoding does depends on what block is passed in Most encodings only transform specific blocks For example the  ImagePreprocessing  encoding maps blocks  Image{N  ImageTensor{N  but leaves other blocks unchanged Encodings are called with  encode  and  decode  which take in the block and the data The actual encoding and decoding takes in an additional context argument which can be specialized on to implement different behavior for e.g training and validation Using an encoding to encode and then decode must be block-preserving i.e if for an encoding  encode  Block1  Block2  then  decode  Block2  Block1  To see the resulting block of applying an encoding to a block we can use  encodedblock  and  decodedblock  You can use  testencoding  to test these invariants to make sure an encoding is implemented properly for a specific block The default implementations of  encodedblock  and  decodedblock  is to return  nothing  indicating that it doesn't transform the data This is overwritten for blocks for which  encode  and  decode  are implemented to indicate that the data is transformed Using  encodedblockfilled(block data  will replace returned  nothing s with the unchanged block Encodings can be applied to tuples of blocks The default behavior is to apply the encoding to each block separately Applying a tuple of encodings will encode the data by applying one encoding after the other When decoding the order is reversed Block learning tasks BlockTask  creates a learning task from blocks and encodings You define the sample block recall for supervised tasks this is a tuple of input and target and a sequence of encodings that are applied to all blocks The below example defines the same learning task as  ImageClassificationSingle  does The first two encodings only change  Image  and the last changes only  Label  so it's simple to understand Now  encode  expects a sample and just runs the encodings over that giving us an encoded input  x  and an encoded target  y  This is equivalent to Image segmentation looks almost the same except we use a  Mask  block as target We're also using  OneHot  here because it also has an  encode  task for  Mask s For this task  ProjectiveTransforms  will be applied to both the  Image  and the  Mask  using the same random state for cropping and augmentation The easiest way to understand how encodings are applied to each block is to use  describetask  and  describeencodings  which print a table of how each encoding is applied successively to each block Rows where a block is  bolded  indicate that the data was transformed by that encoding The above tables make it clear what happens during training encoding a sample and inference encoding an input and decoding an output The more general form  describeencodings  takes in encodings and blocks directly and can be useful for building an understanding of how encodings apply to some blocks Notes Since most encodings just operate on a small number of blocks and keep the rest unchanged applying them to all blocks is usually not a problem When it is because you want some encoding to apply to a specific block only you can use  Named  and  Only  to get around

many examples of how to train models in a supervised fashion However there are many applications of neural networks outside the supervised regime In this tutorial we'll implement and train a variational autoencoder VAE to embed and generate images from the MNIST dataset You'll learn how to implement custom Flux.jl models write a custom training loop generate new images and visualize them Setting up the data First we load the MNIST dataset Since we're not using it for supervised learning we only need the input images and don't load the labels We get a data container where every observation is an image Next we need to define a learning task that will handle data encoding and decoding as well as visualization for us So far we've used  SupervisedTask  a lot which assumes there is an input that is fed to the model and a corresponding target output Since we want to do unsupervised learning we'll instead create a custom learning task using  BlockTask  It defines what kind of data we'll have at each step in the data pipeline for example  x  is a model input and  ŷ  a model output See  AbstractBlockTask  for more info With this helper defined we can create a learning task for our task  Image{2  is the kind of data we want to learn with and  ImagePreprocessing  makes sure to encode and decode these images so they can be used to train a model With the learning task set up we can use  encode  to get samples ready to be input to a model and all  show  functions to visualize data at various points of the pipeline For later training the last thing we need to do with the data is to create a data iterator over batches of encoded samples Since the dataset comfortably fits into memory we preload it all at once by using  collect  on the  DataLoader  This saves us having to reload each image again every epoch With that we have a data iterator of batches that we can use in a training loop just by iterating over it Next we need to construct a model and define a loss function so it can be optimized Modelling The variational autoencoder consists of two parts an encoder and a decoder The encoder takes in data and outputs parameters of a probability distribution These are then used to sample latent vectors which are fed into the decoder to produce new samples A loss function ELBO rewards the model if the outputs are similar to the inputs The challenge is that the latent space is of much lower dimensionality than the data space so the model needs to learn to compress the information contained in the data If you're interested in more mathematical background on VAEs and the loss function Lilian Weng has written a  great write-up on autoencoders  The architecture looks like this Diagram of VAE architecture We define the Variational Autoencoder model as a new type that wraps an encoder and decoder model and define the forward pass and loss function as regular Julia functions Next we define the encoder and decoder models by composing basic Flux.jl layers  Dlatent  is the size of the latent space and controls how much the model has to compress the information Feel free to try out smaller or larger numbers and see how the quality of the generated images changes Custom training loop When dealing with a unconvential learning scheme we usually need to write a custom training loop FastAI.jl is build on top of FluxTraining.jl which allows you to write custom training loops with very little boilerplate while retaining compatibility with its extensive callback system In fact the built-in training loops for supervised learning are defined in just the same way as we will We just defined our own training phase All that is required to take advantage of the FastAI.jl framework is to define the  FluxTraining.step  function We'll use a utility  FluxTraining.runstep  to reduce the boilerplate involved in handling callback events and state  runstep s first argument is a function with inputs  handle state   handle  can be used to dispatch events which callbacks can react to  state  holds data generated on each call to  step  like the batch gradients and loss These are also accessible to callbacks for example to calculate metrics We also give  runstep  the initial step state which just contains our batch Since the step state is a little different from the supervised case there are no targets  ys  we also overwrite the default task for the  ToDevice  callback for our training phase Training Now we can put the pieces together creating a  Learner  To override the default supervised training loops we pass our custom training phase and the data iterator we want to run it on to  fitonecycle  Finally we can visualize how well inputs are reconstructed"},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/FastAI.test_task_show","title":"test_task_show","text":"Test suite that tests that all learning task-related  show  functions work for

keypoint in an image Here we'll be training on a head pose dataset where every image has a person in it and the head of the person is annotated Since keypoint datasets all have different formats we have to do a bit more manual work to get the task dataset loaded First we import everything we'll need Creating a task data container datasetpath  downloads the files but it's up to us to load them into a usable format In the end the task data container should contain tuples of an image and a keypoint each First we create a  loadfolderdata  from the directory where the dataset has been downloaded to Loading a  loadfolderdata  simply treats every file as a single observation However that is not what we want here for every observation we have one image and one annotation file that make up one observation and we want to ignore all other files like the README To achieve this we'll create two data containers containing all the image paths and annotation paths respectively by filtering the container with all paths Next we need to map functions over each observation that load the data from the files An image file can be loaded using the  loadfile  utility The keypoints have a custom format so we write a helper function to parse them from a text file The details of how the format is loaded aren't important Now we can use  mapobs  to lazily map the loading function over the container Note that beside loading the image and keypoint we also extract the subject ID from the path We'll use this in a bit for splitting the dataset appropriately and we don't have access to the path information anymore once we have a container of loaded data We can visualize an observation using  DataAugmentation.showitems  if we wrap the data in item types Before we can start using this data container for training we need to split it into a training and validation dataset Since there are 13 different persons with many images each randomly splitting the container does not make sense The validation dataset would then contain many images that are very similar to those seen in training and would hence say little about the generalization ability of a model We instead use the first 12 subjects as a training dataset and validate on the last The learning task Next we need to define a  learning task  that encodes and augments each image and keypoint in a form that we can train a model on We need to create a  LearningTask  struct for which we can define these transformations Here we make use of  ProjectiveTransforms  for resizing cropping and augmenting the image and keypoint and  ImagePreprocessing  to reshape and normalize the image Finally  KeypointPreprocessing  makes sure keypoints fall between 1 and 1 We can check that each image is resized to  224 224  and the keypoints are normalized Decoding the encoded targets should give back a point within the original image bounds That is looking good We can see that the keypoint is aligned with center of the head even after heavy augmentation Now it is finally time to train a model Training We'll use a modified ResNet as a model backbone and add a couple layers that regress the keypoint  taskmodel  knows how to do this by looking at the data blocks used and calling  blockmodel KeypointTensor{2 Float32}((1 KeypointTensor{2 Float32}((1 backbone  The implementation for reference looks like this Next we create a pair of training and validation data loaders They take care of batching and loading the data in parallel in the background With the addition of an optimizer and a loss function we can now create a  Learner  and start training Just like  taskmodel   tasklossfn  selects the appropriate loss function for a  BlockTask s blocks Here both the encoded target block and model output block are  block  KeypointTensor{2 Float32}((1  so  blocklossfn(block block  is called which returns Mean Squared Error as a suitable loss function The loss is going down which is a good sign but visualizing the predictions against the ground truth will give us a better idea of how well the model performs We'll use  showoutputs  to compare batches of encoded targets and model outputs For this we can run the model on a batch from the validation dataset and see how it performs We can also see that the trained model generalizes well to the heavy augmentation employed during training The augmentation also explains why the training loss is so much higher than the validation loss"},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/MLUtils.leavepout","title":"leavepout","text":"julia train_idx val_idx train val

ImageClassification Presizing vision datasets for performance In this tutorial we'll look at how we can improve the performance of computer vision data pipelines by presizing Presizing is a dataset preprocessing step executed before any training in which all images are loaded and saved at a smaller size This can improve performance if image loading is a bottleneck Presizing is useful when the original image sizes in a dataset are much larger than the size we use during training if the images are downsized every time they are loaded anyway a lot of work can be avoided by doing this once before training For example if we train an image classification model on resized image crops of size  160 160  then we can presize every image so that the shorter length is at least 160 Let's first look at the performance difference at this makes Conveniently the ImageNette dataset comes in 3 sizes original 320px and 160px Let's download them and create data containers that load the images and do nothing else Now every observation is simply a single image but the sizes vary Let's see how long it takes to load a random subset of 100 images Quite a difference The 320px version loads about 4 times slower than the 160px version after all there are 4 times as many pixels Note that image loading is only a part of the data pipeline Optimizing it with presizing only makes sense if it becomes a bottleneck See  Performant data pipelines  for a more general discussion Implementing presizing Next we'll look at how to do presizing ourselves For an image classification dataset this entails copying the folder structure but replacing every image with a downscaled version Let's say as above we want to train a model on images of size 160 160 Since we still want to use random crops during training we don't want to do the cropping yet Instead we downscale the image while preserving the aspect ratio so that the smallest side is still at least 160 pixels long The following function does just that for a single image Now we need to run this over every image in a folder To speed things up we run this in parallel using  Threads.@threads  We can now load the created dataset as a regular image classification dataset Remarks Keypoint and segmentation data  Presizing can of course be useful with other image datasets like those for segmantic segmentation and with keypoint data You have to be more careful when presizing those though since the target variable is affected by the resizing if an image is downsized then any segmentation masks and keypoints on it also need to be downsized Progressive resizing  Presizing can also be used in conjunction with progressive resizing a technique pioneered by Jeremy Howard where the training starts with small image sizes for speed and uses larger image sizes later for better performance This can improve convergence speed quite a

the tests FastAI.jl uses  ReTest.jl  to set up tests which makes it possible to run subsets of tests or only tests that have not previously succeeded First activate the test environment and install its dependencies Then you can run the test suite or subsets of it Local documentation preview FastAI.jl uses  Pollen.jl  as its documentation system which allows you to preview documentation locally First activate the documentation environment and install its dependencies Now you can build the documentation locally giving you a preview at  http://localhost:3000  Using the  lazy  true  will build pages lazily only once you request them on the website which reduces the build time when you only care about specific pages Adding documentation pages files Documentation pages correspond to a Markdown  md  or Jupyter Notebook  ipynb  file that should be stored in the  docs  folder If a document should show up in the left sidebar of the docs page add an entry to  FastAI/docs/toc.json  Jupyter Notebooks should be used when they use resources that are not available on the GitHub CI like a GPU needed for training You should run them locally and the outputs will be captured and inserted into the HTML page Markdown documents should be preferred for everything else as they allow the code examples to be run on the GitHub CI meaning they'll stay up-to-date unlike a notebook that has to be manually rerun Both formats support the  Markdown syntax of Publish.jl  and in markdown files the  cell syntax of Publish.jl  can be used to mark code cells These will be run and the output is inserted into the HTML page Linking to documentation For a new documentation file to be discoverable you have to add an entry to the nested Markdown list in  toc.md  which corresponds to the sidebar in the documentation  updating the sidebar currently requires interrupting and reincluding the file that starts the development server  Documentation pages can also link to each other using

learning tasks This tutorial explains the low-level interface behind  BlockTask s and how to use it to create your custom learning tasks without the data block interface In the  quickstart  section you've already seen a learning task in action  BlockTask  The learning task abstraction powers FastAI.jl's high-level interface allowing you to make training models for a task simple  BlockTask  is a particularly convenient and composable interface for creating learning tasks and should be preferred for most use cases However to get a look behind the scenes in this tutorial we'll use the lower-level learning task interface to implement our own version of an image classification learning task You're encouraged to follow along in a REPL or notebook This tutorial can also serve as a template for implementing a custom learning task for your own project A learning task describes how we need to process data so we can train a model for some task In our case the task we want to solve is to classify an image The task defines what kind of data we need here pairs of images and class labels That alone however isn't enough to train a model since we can't just throw an image in any format into a model and get a class out Almost always the input data needs to be processed in some way before it is input to a model we call this  encoding  and the same goes for the model outputs we call this  decoding  So let's say we have an image and a trained model How do we make a prediction First we encode the image run it through the model and then decode the output Similarly how we can use a pair of image and class to train a model We encode both run the encoded input through the model and then compare the output with the encoded class using a  loss function  The result tells us how we'll need to update the weights of the model to improve its performance In essence the learning task interface allows us to implement these steps and derive useful functionality from it like training and evaluating models Later we'll also cover some optional interfaces that allow us to define other parts of a deep learning project Datasets Before we get started let's load up a  data container  that we can test our code on as we go It's always a good idea to interactively test your code Since we'll be implementing a task for image classification the observations in our data container will of course have to be pairs of images and classes We'll use one of the many image classification datasets available from the fastai dataset repository I'll use ImageNette but you can use any of the datasets listed in  FastAI.Datasets.DATASETS_IMAGECLASSIFICATION  The way the interface is built allows you to easily swap out the dataset you're using We'll also collect the unique class names Implementation Learning task struct Now let's get to it The first thing we need to do is to create a  LearningTask  struct The  LearningTask   struct  should contain all the configuration needed for encoding and decoding the data We'll keep it simple here and include a list of the classes and the image dimensions input to the model Now we can create an instance of it though of course it can't do anything yet Encoding and decoding There are 3 tasks we need to define before we can use our learning task to train models and make predictions encodesample  which encodes an image and a class encodeinput  will encode an image so it can be input to a model decodeypred  decodes a model output into a class label Note These functions always operate on  single  images and classes even if we want to pass batches to the model later on While it's not the focus of this tutorial let's give a quick recap of how the data is encoded and decoded for image classification Images are cropped to a common size so they can be batched converted to a 3D array with dimensions height width color channels and normalized Classes are encoded as one-hot vectors teaching the model to predict a confidence distribution over all classes To decode a predicted one-hot vector we can simply find the index with the highest value and look up the class label Each of the tasks also takes a  context FastAI.Context  argument which allows it to behave differently during training validation and inference We'll make use of that to choose a different image crop for each situation During training we'll use a random crop for augmentation while during validation a center crop will ensure that any metrics we track are the same every epoch During inference we won't crop the image so we don't lose any information Inputs We implement  encodeinput  using  DataAugmentation.jl  Feel free to look at  its documentation  we won't focus on it here If we test this out on an image it should give us a 3D array of size  128 128 3  and indeed it does Outputs encodetarget  is much simpler The same goes for the decoding step Training And that's all we need to start training models There are some optional interfaces that make that even easier but let's use what we have for now With our  LearningTask  defined we can use  taskdataloaders  to turn a dataset into a set of training and validation data loaders that can be thrown into a training loop Now with a makeshift model an optimizer and a loss function we can create a  Learner  From here you're free to start training using   fit  or  fitonecycle  These tasks are also enough to use  predict  and  predictbatch  once you've trained a model Additional interfaces Training interface We can implement some additional tasks to make our life easier Specifically let's implement every task needed to use  tasklearner  tasklossfn  return a loss function  lossfn(ys ys  comparing a batch of model outputs and encoded targets taskmodel  from a backbone construct a model suitable for the task Let's start with the loss function We want to compare two one-hot encoded categorical variables for which categorical cross entropy is the most commonly used loss function For the model we'll assume we're getting a convolutional feature extractor passed in as a backbone so its output will be of size height width channels batch size  Flux.outputsize  can be used to calculate the output size of arbitrary models without having to evaluate the model We'll use it to check the number of output channels of the backbone Then we add a

page  we showed how to train models on common tasks in a few lines of code like these Each of the five lines encapsulates one part of the deep learning pipeline to give a high-level API while still allowing customization Let's have a closer look Dataset This line downloads and loads the  ImageNette  image classification dataset a small subset of ImageNet with 10 different classes  data  is a  data container  that can be used to load individual observations here of images and the corresponding labels We can use  getobs(data i  to load the  i th observation and  numobs  to find out how many observations there are blocks  describe the format of the data that you want to use for learning For supervised training tasks they are a tuple of  inputblock targetblock  Since we want to do image classification the input block is  Image{2  representing a 2-dimensional image and the target block is  Label(classes  representing the class the image belongs to Learning task The next line defines a learning task which encapsulates the data preprocessing pipeline and other logic related to the task  ImageClassificationSingle  is a simple wrapper around  BlockTask  which takes in blocks and data processing steps so-called  encodings  Using it we can replace the above line with Based on the blocks and encodings the learning task can derive lots of functionality data processing visualization constructing task-specific models from a backbone creating a loss function Learner Next we create a  Learner  that encapsulates everything needed for training including parallelized training and validation data loaders using  taskdataloaders a loss function using  tasklossfn a task-specific model using  taskmodel The customizable expanded version of the code looks like this At this step we can also pass in any number of  callbacks  to customize the training Here  ToGPU  ensures an available GPU is used and  Metrics  adds additional metrics to track during training Training Training now is quite simple You have several options for high-level training schedules lrfind  to run a learning rate finder finetune  for when you're using a pretrained backbone fitonecycle  for when you're training a model from scratch Visualization Finally the last line visualizes the predictions of the trained model It takes some samples from the training data loader runs them through the model and decodes the outputs How each piece of data is visualized is also inferred through the blocks in the learning

blocks load findfirst id blocks image mask sample data size sample eltype sample inputblock targetblock blocks targetblock inputblock targetblock image mask blocks blocks task blocks size Discovery As you may have seen in  the introduction  FastAI.jl makes it possible to train models in just 5 lines of code However if you have a task in mind you need to know what datasets you can train on and if there are convenience learning task constructors For example the introduction loads the  imagenette2-160  dataset and uses  ImageClassificationSingle  to construct a learning task Now what if instead of classifying an image into one class we want to classify every single pixel into a class semantic segmentation Now we need a dataset with pixel-level annotations and a learning task that can process those segmentation masks For finding both we can make use of  Block s A  Block  represents a kind of data for example images labels or keypoints For supervised learning tasks we have an input block and a target block If we wanted to classify whether 2D images contain a cat or a dog we could use the blocks  Image{2 Label([\"cat dog  while for semantic segmentation we'll have an input  Image  block and a target  Mask  block Finding a dataset To find a dataset with compatible samples we can pass the types of these blocks as a filter to  datasets  which will show us only dataset recipes for loading those blocks We can see that the  camvid_tiny  dataset can be loaded so that each sample is a pair of an image and a segmentation mask Let's use a data recipe to load a  data container  and concrete blocks As with every data container we can load a sample using  getobs  which gives us a tuple of an image and a segmentation mask Loading the dataset recipe also returned  blocks  which are the concrete  Block  instances for the dataset We passed in  types  of blocks  Image Mask  and get back  instances  since the specifics of some blocks depend on the dataset For example the returned target block carries the labels for every class that a pixel can belong to With these  blocks  we can also validate a sample of data using  checkblock  which is useful as a sanity check when using custom data containers Summary In short if you have a learning task in mind and want to load a dataset for that task then define the types of input and target block e.g  blocktypes  Image Label  use  filter datarecipes  blocks=blocktypes  to find compatbile dataset recipes and run  load datarecipes id  to load a data container and the concrete blocks Exercises Find and load a dataset for multi-label image classification Hint the block for multi-category outputs is called  LabelMulti  List all datasets with  Image  as input block and any target block Hint the supertype of all types is  Any  Finding a learning task Armed with a dataset we can go to the next step creating a learning task Since we already have blocks defined this amounts to defining the encodings that are applied to the data before it is used in training Here FastAI.jl already defines some convenient constructors for learning tasks and you can find them with  learningtasks  Here we can pass in either block types as above or the block instances Looks like we can use the  ImageSegmentation  function to create a learning task Every function returned can be called with  blocks  and optionally some keyword

the  quickstart section  you saw a short example of how to train an image segmentation model In this tutorial we'll recreate that using the mid-level APIs In image segmentation instead of assigning a class to a whole image as in  image classification  we want to classify each pixel of an image We'll use the CamVid dataset which contains street images with every pixel annotated as one of 32 classes Inside the dataset folder we find  images  a subfolder with all the input images  labels  a subfolder containing the segmentation masks saved as images and  codes.txt  which contains the class names Every line in  codes.txt  corresponds to one class so let's load it To create our data containers we'll use  loadfolderdata  which creates data containers from folder contents The function  loadfn  is applied to the file paths and we use  loadfile  to  loadmask  to get images and masks Now we can get an observation Each mask is an array with elements the same type as our classes here  String  but efficiently stored using integers under the hood Next we need to create a learning task for image segmentation This means using images to predict masks so we'll use the  Image  and  Mask  blocks as input and target Since the dataset is 2D we'll use 2-dimensional blocks The encodings passed in transform samples into formats suitable as inputs and outputs for a model and also allow decoding model outputs to get back to our target format an array of class labels for every pixel Let's check that samples from the created data container conform to the blocks of the learning task We can ascertain the encodings work as expected by creating a batch of encoded data and visualizing it Here the segmentation masks are color-coded and overlayed on top of the image We can use  describetask  to get more information about learning tasks created through the data block API We see which representations our data goes through and which encodings transform which parts With a  task  and a matching data container the only thing we need before we can create a  Learner  is a backbone architecture to build the segmentation model from We'll use a slightly modified ResNet but you can use any convolutional architecture We'll use  taskmodel  to construct the model from the backbone Since we want mask outputs the intermediate feature representation needs to be scaled back up Based on the  Block s we built our task from  taskmodel  knows that it needs to build a mapping  ImageTensor{2  OneHotTensor{2  and constructs a U-Net model In a similar vein  tasklossfn  creates a loss function suitable for comparing model outputs and encoded targets Next we turn our data container into training and validation data loaders that will iterate over batches of encoded data and construct a  Learner  Note that we could also have used  tasklearner  which is a shorthand that calls  taskdataloaders  and  taskmodel  for us Now let's finetune the model And look at the results on a batch of validation data The data block API can also be used for 3D segmentation but the tutorial for that is still in the works"},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/DataAugmentation.setwrapped","title":"setwrapped","text":""},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/FluxTraining.Write","title":"Write","text":""},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/FluxTraining.callbackgraph","title":"callbackgraph","text":"Creates

to stay as close to the original as possible but diverges where the APIs differ In this tutorial we will see how to deal with a new type of task using the middle layer of the fastai library The example we will use is a Siamese network that takes two images and determine if they are of the same class or not In particular we will see how to quickly get DataLoaders from a standard PyTorch Datasets how to adapt this in a Transform to get some of the show features of fastai how to add some new behavior to show_batch/show_results for a custom task how to write a custom DataBlock how to create your own model from a pretrained model how to pass along a custom splitter to Learner to take advantage of transfer learning UPDATE Setup Since we'll be implementing some image operations manually we'll add the  Images  package Preparing the data To make our data ready for training a model we need to create data iterators for training and validation for example using  DataLoader  Usually the first step is to create a  data container  that is then wrapped inside a  DataLoader  Unlike in fast.ai FastAI.jl separates the loading part from the encoding part In this case loading means getting pairs of images and encoding includes preprocessing and augmenting them We'll first create a data container that just loads pairs of images and later show how to apply transforms on top of that Using the low-level API First we'll use  datasetpath  to download and untar the dataset and then find all image files We can open the first image and have a look at it Note that array indices start at 1 in Julia Let's wrap all the standard preprocessing resize and conversion to tensor and reordering of the channels in one helper function Note some differences to Python here images by default are 2D-arrays of pixels so we need to use  channelview  to get a 3D array with the color dimension expanded pixel values are assumed to be between 0 and 1 so we do not need to divide them by 255 For flexibility we also separate the loading  loadfile  from the transformations applied to the image We can see the label of our image is in the filename before the last  and some number We can then use a regex expression to create a label function Now let's gather all unique labels We could now use  mapobs  to create a data container from our list of files It applies a function like loading an image lazily and we can get single observations using  getobs  and the number of observtions with  numobs  It is the same as a  torch.utils.data.Dataset  For example the following example creates a data container with tuples of an image and a category that could be used for image classification To create our Siamese datasets however we will need to create tuples of images for inputs and the target will be  true  if the images are of the same class  false  otherwise First we'll shuffle the files and split them into a training and a validation set Let's create a custom data container that returns pairs of indices and a Boolean indicating whether the label is the same Half of the pairs will have the same label and half will not Additionally during training the other image will be chosen randomly while for the validation the pairs will always be the same While you can get far with basic data containers like  loadfolderdata  and transformations like  mapobs  and  filterobs  sometimes it's simplest to create a custom data container You just need to implement  getobs  and  numobs  for your type similar to how you would implement  getindex  and  len  for a PyTorch  Dataset  We can combine this data container that gives us pairs of indices with the files and map the loading and preprocessing functions over it to get a data container that is ready to be passed to a  DataLoader  We can see that each observation consists of two images and a Boolean To use the above data containers in training we can simply pass them to a  DataLoader  Next let's look at how we can extend this example to make use FastAI.jl's data augmentation visualize our data and more Using the Data Block API This is where FastAI.jl's API diverges a bit from fast.ai's Note how above we made sure to separate the data container creation and loading from disk from the preprocessing that is applied to every observation In FastAI.jl the preprocessing or encoding is implemented through  a learning task  Learning tasks contain any configuration and beside data processing have extensible functions for visualizations and model building One advantage of this separation between loading and encoding is that the data container can easily be swapped out as long as it has observations suitable for the learning task in this case a tuple of two images and a Boolean It also makes it easy to  export  models and all the necessary configuration The easiest way to create learning tasks is using the data block API which should suit the very most of all use cases It is also possible to directly  implement the lower-level  LearningTask  interface  The best way to understand it is to use it so let's build a learning task for Siamese image similarity We specify the kinds of input and target data as  blocks  Here we have two 2D images as input  Image{2 Image{2  and a binary label  Label([true false  as output We also pass in a tuple of encodings that describe how the data is transformed before being fed to a model Here  ProjectiveTransforms  resizes the images to the same size  ImagePreprocessing  converts the images to the right format and  OneHot  one-hot encodes the labels We can get a better understanding of the representations the data goes through using  describetask  We can reuse all the code above for creating the data container we just omit the preprocessing function  taskdataloaders  constructs training and validation data loaders from data containers by mapping the task encoding over the data containers The above is equivalent to lazily mapping the encoding over the data containers and creating a  DataLoader  from them By separating the data container preparation from the task-specific data preprocessing and augmentation we were able to completely reuse the data container creation and quickly add FastAI.jl's data augmentation With the data iterators ready for training we still need a model to train For the Siamese similarity setting a common model architecture is a encoder/feature extractor that is applied to both images and a head that transforms the concatenated image features resulting in a similar/not similar categorical output Flux.jl makes it easy to create models in a similar fashion to PyTorch modules The forward pass is implemented by overloading the call operator and the backward pass is automatically generated We'll use a XResNet model for the encoder and the same head that is used for classification models Using  Flux.outputsize  we can check how many channels the encoder outputs without having to evaluate the model We need to double this feature count since the head gets the concatenated features from two images Let's test the model works on a batch of training data We'll use categorical crossentropy for logits as a loss function and ADAM as optimizer Now we can create a  Learner  and start training following the usual process"},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/Flux.Recur","title":"Recur","text":"accum h x h x x rnn accum rnn rnn rnn state rnn rnn state accum h x h x x rnn accum Int rnn rnn rnn state rnn

sample dataset from fastai and try to predict whether the salary is above 50K or not making this a binary classification task We can quickly download and get the path of any dataset from fastai by using  datasetpath  Once we have the path we'll load the data in a  TableDataset  By default if we pass in just the path to  TableDataset  the data is loaded in a  DataFrame  but we can use any package for accessing our data and pass an object satisfying the  Tables.jl  interface to it In case our data was present in a different format for eg parquet it could be loaded into a data container as follows mapobs  is used here to split our target column from the rest of the row in a lazy manner so that each observation consists of a row of inputs and a target variable To create a learning task for tabular classification task we need an input block an output block and the encodings to be performed on the data The input block here is a  TableRow  which contains information about the nature of the columns ie categorical or continuous along with an indexable collection mapping categorical column names to a collection with distinct classes in that column We can get this mapping by using the  gettransformationdict  task with  DataAugmentation.Categorify  The outblock block used is  Label  for single column classification and the unique classes have to passed to it This is followed by the encodings which needs to be applied on our input and output blocks For the input block we have used the  gettransforms  function here to get a standard bunch of transformations to apply but this can be easily customized by passing in any tabular transformation from DataAugmentation.jl or a composition of those to  TabularPreprocessing  In addition to this we have just one-hot encoded the outblock In case our initial problem wasn't a classification task and we had a continuous target column we would need to perform tabular regression To create a learning task suitable for regression we use a  Continuous  block for representing our target column This can be done even with multiple continuous target columns by just passing the number of columns in  Continuous  For example the task here could be used for 3 targets To get an overview of the learning task created and as a sanity test we can use  describetask  This shows us what encodings will be applied to which blocks and how the predicted ŷ values are decoded getobs  gets us a row of data from the  TableDataset  which we encode here This gives us a tuple with the input and target The input here is again a tuple containing the categorical values which have been label encoded or categorified and the continuous values which have been normalized and any missing values have been filled To get a model suitable for our learning task we can use  taskmodel  which constructs a suitable model based on the target block Of course you can also create a custom backbone using the functions present in  FastAI.Models  We can then pass a named tuple  categorical   continuous    to  taskmodel  to replace the default backbone To directly get a  Learner  suitable for our task and data we can use the  tasklearner  function This creates both batched data loaders and a model for us Once we have a  Learner  we can call  fitonecycle  on it to train it for the desired number of

comparison FastAI.jl is in many ways similar to the original Python  fastai  but also has its differences This reference goes through all the sections in the  fastai A Layered API for Deep Learning  paper and comments what the interfaces for the same functionality in FastAI.jl are and where they differ or functionality is still missing Applications FastAI.jl's own data block API makes it possible to derive every part of a high-level interface with a unified API across tasks Instead it suffices to create a learning task and based on the blocks and encodings specified the proper model builder loss function and visualizations are implemented see below For a high-level API a complete  Learner  can be constructed using  tasklearner  without much boilerplate There are some helper functions for  creating these learning tasks for example  ImageClassificationSingle  and  ImageSegmentation  FastAI.jl additionally has a unified API for registering and discovering functionality across applications also based on the data block abstraction   datasets  and  datarecipes  let you quickly load common datasets matching some data modality and  learningtasks  lets you find learning task helpers for common tasks See  the discovery tutorial  for more info Vision Computer vision is well-supported in FastAI.jl with different tasks and optimized data pipelines for N-dimensional images masks and keypoints See the tutorial section for many examples Tabular FastAI.jl also has support for tabular data Deployment Through FastAI.jl's  LearningTask  interface the data processing logic is decoupled from the dataset creation and training and can be easily serialized and loaded to make predictions See the tutorial on  saving and loading models  There is no integration yet for text and collaborative filtering applications High-level API High-level API foundations FastAI.jl also has a data block API but it differs from fastai's in a number of ways In the Julia package it only handles the data encoding and decoding part and doesn't concern itself with creating datasets For dataset loading see the  data container API  As mentioned above the high-level application-specific logic is also derived from the data block API To use it you need to specify a tuple of input and target blocks as well as a tuple of encodings that are applied to the data The encodings  are invertible data-specific data processing steps which correspond to  fastai.Transform s As in fastai dispatch is used to transform applicable data and pass other data through unchanged Unlike in fastai there are no default steps associated with a block allowing greater flexibility We can create a  BlockTask  similar to  fastai.DataBlock  and get information about the representations the data goes through From this short definition many things can be derived data encoding model output decoding how to create a model from a backbone the loss function to use how to visualize samples and predictions Together with a  data container   data  we can quickly create a  Learner  using  tasklearner  which like in fastai handles the training for us There are no application-specific  Learner  constructors like  cnn_learner  or  unet_learner  in FastAI.jl High-level training protocols like the  one-cycle learning rate schedule   fine-tuning  and the  learning rate finder  are then available to us Incrementally adapting PyTorch code Since it is a Julia package FastAI.jl is not written on top of PyTorch but a Julia library for deep learning  Flux.jl  In any case the point of this section is to note that the abstractions in fastai are decoupled and existing projects can easily be reused This is also the case for FastAI.jl as it is built on top of several decoupled libraries Many of these were built specifically for FastAI.jl but they are unaware of each other and useful in their own right Flux.jl  provides models optimizers and loss functions fulfilling a similar role to PyTorch MLUtils.jl  gives you tools for building and transforming data containers Also it takes care of efficient parallelized iteration of data containers DataAugmentation.jl  takes care of the lower levels of high-performance composable data augmentations FluxTraining.jl  contributes a highly extensible training loop with 2-way callbacks If that seems like a lot don't worry If you've installed FastAI.jl the functionality of most of these packages is reexported and you don't have to install any of them explicitly Consistency across domains While computer vision is the only domain with mature support for now the abstractions underlying FastAI.jl are carefully crafted to ensure that learning tasks for different domains can be created using the same set of interfaces This shows in that there's no need for application-specific functionality above the data block API Mid-level APIs Learner The  Learner  is very similar to fastai's It takes a model any parameterized differentiable function like a neural network or even  a trebuchet simulator training and validation data iterators these can be  DataLoader s which paralellize data loading but any iterator over batches can be used optimizer loss function Two-way callbacks The training loop also supports two-way callbacks See the  FluxTraining.jl docs  for a list of all available callbacks While supporting all the functionality of fastai's callbacks and training loop it also provides  an extensible training loop API  that makes it straightforward to integrate custom training steps with the available callbacks As a result different training steps for problems other than standard supervised training can make use of existing callbacks  without the need to handle control flow through callbacks Additionally callbacks have an additional level of safety by being required to declare what state they access and modify With a little more effort up-front this guarantees correct ordering of callback execution through  a dependency graph  In the future this will also make it possible to automatically run callbacks in parallel and asynchronously to reduce overhead by long-running callbacks like costly metric calculations and logging over the network Encodings and blocks In the paper this subsection is in the low-level section named Transforms and Pipelines but I'm putting it here since it is the core of FastAI.jl's data block API FastAI.jl provides  Encoding s and  Block s which correspond to fastai's  Transform s and  Block s Encodings implement an  encode  and optionally  decode  function that describes how data corresponding to some blocks is transformed and how that transformation can be inverted There is also support for stateful encodings like  ProjectiveTransforms  which need to use the same random state to augment every data point Additionally encodings describe what kind of block data is returned from encoding allowing inspection of the whole data pipeline The  Block s are used to dispatch in the  encode  function to implement block-specific transformations If no  encode  task is implemented for a pair of encoding and block the default is to pass the data through unchanged like in fastai The  Block s also allow implementing task-specific functionality blocklossfn  takes a prediction and encoded target block to determine a good loss function to use For example for image classification we want to compare two one-hot encoded labels and hence define  blocklossfn(::OneHotTensor{0 OneHotTensor{0  logitcrossentropy  blockmodel  constructs a model from a backbone that maps an input block to an output block For example for image segmentation we have  ImageTensor{N  as the input block and  OneHotTensor{N  one-hot encoded N-dimensional masks as output so  blockmodel  turns the backbone into a U-Net showblock  defines how to visualize a block of data Generic optimizer FastAI.jl uses the optimizers from Flux.jl which provides a similarly  composable API for optimzers  Generalized metric API Metrics are handled by the  Metrics  callback which takes in reducing metric functions or  FluxTraining.AbstractMetric s which have a similar API to fastai's fastai.data.external FastAI.jl makes all the same datasets available in  fastai.data.external  available See  datasets  for a list of all datasets that can be downloaded funcs_kwargs and DataLoader fastai.data.core In FastAI.jl you are not restricted to a specific type of data iterator and can pass any iterator over batches to  Learner  In cases where performance is important  DataLoader  can speed up data iteration by loading and batching samples in parallel on background threads All transformations of data happen through the data container interface which requires a type to implement  Base.getindex  MLUtils.getobs  and  Base.length  MLUtils.numobs  similar to PyTorch's  torch.utils.data.Dataset  Data containers are then transformed into other data containers Some examples mapobs f data  lazily maps a function  f  of over  data  such that  getobs(mapobs(f data idx  f(getobs(data idx  For example  mapobs(loadfile files  turns a vector of image files into a data container of images DataLoader(data batchsize  is a wrapper around  BatchView  which turns a data container of samples into one of collated batches and  eachobsparallel  which creates a parallel buffered iterator over the observations here batches in the resulting container groupobs f data  splits a container into groups using a grouping function  f  For example  groupobs(grandparentname files  creates training splits for files where the grandparent folder indicates the split MLUtils.ObsView data idxs  lazily takes a subset of the observations in  data  For more information see the  data container tutorial  and the  MLUtils.jl docs  At a higher level there are also convenience functions like  loadfolderdata  to create data containers Layers and architectures Flux.jl already does a better job at functionally creating model architectures than PyTorch so FastAI.jl makes use of its layers For example  Flux.SkipConnection   corresponds to fastai's  MergeLayer  The  FastAI.Models  submodule currently provides some high-level architectures like  xresnet18  and a U-Net builder  UNetDynamic  that can create U-Nets from  any  convolutional feature extractor The  optional dependency   Metalhead.jl  also provides common pretrained vision models Low-level APIs Due to the nature of the Julia language and its design around multiple dispatch packages tend to compose really well so it was not necessary to reimplement or provide a unified API for low-level operations We'll comment on the libraries that we were able to use PyTorch foundations Unlike Python Julia has native support for N-dimensional regular arrays As such there is a standard interface for arrays and libraries don't need to implement their own Consider that every deep learning framework in Python implements their own CPU and GPU arrays which is part of the reason they are  frameworks  not  libraries  with the latter being vastly preferable Julia's standard libraries implements the standard CPU  Array  type GPU arrays are implemented through  CUDA.jl   CuArray  type with unified support for GPU vendors other than nvidia in the works As a result Flux.jl the deep learning library of choice for FastAI.jl does not need to reimplement their own CPU and GPU array versions This kind of composability in general largely benefits what can be accomplished in Julia Some other libraries which are used under the hood for image processing the  Images.jl  ecosystem of packages is used for reading and processing tabular data  DataFrames.jl  and  Tables.jl  for plotting  Makie.jl  Type dispatch Multiple dispatch already is a core feature of the Julia language hence the extensible interfaces in FastAI.jl are built around it and are natural fit for the language Object-oriented semantic tensors As mentioned above Julia has great support for arrays with extra functionality available to packages that provide wrapper arrays like  NamedDims.jl  which should generally  just work  with every part of the library Hence there is no need for an addtional API that unifies separate packages which in turn makes FastAI.jl more composable with other packages In encodings the array types are used for dispatch only where an especially performant implementation is possible and the block information is used for dispatching the semantics of the encoding GPU-accelerated augmentation FastAI.jl does not support GPU-accelerated augmentation yet Please open an issue if you run into a situation where data processing  becomes the bottleneck  and we'll prioritize this The affine transformations implemented in DataAugmentation.jl and used in FastAI.jl are properly composed to ensure high quality results They are also optimized for speed and memory usage with complete support for inplace transformations Convenience functionality Much of the convenience provided by fastai is not required in Julia delegates  Due to the absence of deep class hierarchies keyword arguments are seldom passed around the only instance where this happens in FastAI.jl is  tasklearner  patch  since Julia is built around multiple dispatch not classes you just implement the task for a type no patching needed L  due to first-class array support such a wrapper list container isn't needed nbdev There is no  nbdev equivalent in Julia at the moment That said this documentation is generated by a document creation package  Pollen.jl  that could be extended to support such a workflow It already has support for different source and output formats like Jupyter notebooks code execution and is built for interactive work with incremental rebuilds Hopefully this page has given you some context for how FastAI.jl relates to fastai and how to map concepts between the two You are encouraged to go through the tutorials to see the design decisions made in practice"},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/Flux.ones","title":"ones","text":""},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/Flux.Losses.huber_loss","title":"huber_loss","text":"Return the

you have available to you This means that data pipelines need to be fast enough to keep the GPU at 100 utilization that is keep it from starving Reducing the time the GPU has to wait for the next batch of data directly lowers the training time until the GPU is fully utilized There are other ways to reduce training time like using hyperparameter schedules and different optimizers for faster convergence but we'll only talk about improving GPU utilization here Reasons for low GPU utilization The main cause of low GPU utilization is that the next batch of data is not available after a training step and the GPU has to wait This means that in order to get full GPU utilization loading a batch must not take longer than a training step and the data must be loaded in the background so that it is ready the moment the GPU needs it These issues can be addressed by using worker threads to load multiple batches in parallel keeping the primary thread free and reducing the time it takes to load a single batch FastAI.jl by default uses  DataLoader  from the  DataLoaders.jl  package which addresses points 1 and 2 For those familiar with PyTorch it closely resembles  torch.utils.data.DataLoader  It also efficiently collates the data by reusing a buffer where supported We can measure the large performance difference by comparing a naive sequential data iterator with  eachobsparallel  the data iterator that  DataLoader  uses Running each timer twice to forego compilation time the sequential iterator takes 20 seconds while the parallel iterator using 11 background threads only takes 2.5 seconds This certainly isn't a proper benchmark but it shows the performance can be improved by an order of magnitude with no effort Beside increasing the amount of compute available with worker threads as above the data loading performance can also be improved by reducing the time it takes to load a single batch Since a batch is made up of some number of observations this usually boils down to reducing the loading time of a single observation If you're using the  LearningTask  API this can be further broken down into the loading and encoding part Measuring performance So how do you know if your GPU is underutilized If it isn't then improving data pipeline performance won't help you at all One way to check this is to start training and run   watch n 0.1 nvidia-smi  in a terminal which displays and refreshs GPU stats every 1/10th of a second If  GPU-Util  stays between 90 and 99 you're good If that's not the case you might see it frantically jumping up and down We can get a better estimate of how much training time can be sped up by running the following experiment Load one batch and run  n  optimization steps on this batch The time this takes corresponds to the training time when the GPU does not have to wait for data to be available Next take your data iterator and time iterating over the first  n  batches  without  an optimization step The speed of the complete training loop data loading and optimization will be around the maximum of either measurement Roughly speaking if 1 takes 100 seconds and 2 takes 200 seconds you know that you can speed up training by about a factor of 2 if you reduce data loading time by half after which the GPU will become the bottleneck Again make sure to run each measurement twice so you don't include the compilation time To find performance bottlenecks in the loading of each observation you'll want to compare the time it takes to load an observation of the task data container and the time it takes to encode that observation This will give you a pretty good idea of where the performance bottleneck is Note that the encoding performance is often dependent of the task configuration If we used  ImageClassification  with input size  64 64  it would be much faster Improving performance So you've identified the data pipeline as a performance bottleneck What now Before anything else make sure you're doing the following Use  DataLoaders.DataLoader  as a data iterator If you're using  taskdataloaders  or  tasklearner  this is already the case Start Julia with multiple threads by specifying the  t n  t auto  flag when starting Julia If it is successful  Threads.nthreads  should be larger than  1  If the data loading is still slowing down training you'll probably have to speed up the loading of each observation As mentioned above this can be broken down into observation loading and encoding The exact strategy will depend on your use case but here are some examples Reduce loading time of image datasets by presizing For many computer vision tasks you will resize and crop images to a specific size during training for GPU performance reasons If the images themselves are large loading them from disk itself can take some time If your dataset consists of 1920x1080 resolution images but you're resizing them to 256x256 during training you're wasting a lot of time loading the large images  Presizing  means saving resized versions of each image to disk once and then loading these smaller versions during training We can see the performance difference using ImageNette since it comes in 3 sizes original 360px and 180px Reducing allocations with inplace operations When implementing the  LearningTask  interface you have the option to implement  encode!(buf task context sample  an inplace version of  encode  that reuses a buffer to avoid allocations Reducing allocations often speeds up the encoding step and can also reduce the frequency of garbage collector pauses during training which can reduce GPU utilization Using efficient data augmentation Many kinds of augmentation can be composed efficiently A prime example of this are image transformations like resizing scaling and cropping which are powered by  DataAugmentation.jl  See  its documentation  to find out how to implement efficient composable data

blocks load entry Data containers This tutorial explains what data containers are how they are used in FastAI.jl and how to create your own You are encouraged to follow along in a REPL or a Jupyter notebook and explore the code You will find small exercises at the end of some sections to deepen your understanding Introduction In the  quickstart  section you have already come in contact with data containers The following code was used to load a data container for image classification A data container is any type that holds observations of data and allows us to load them with  getobs  and query the number of observations with  numobs  In this case each observation is a tuple of an image and the corresponding class after all we want to use it for image classification load datasets id  makes it easy to a load a data container that is compatible with some block types but to get a better feel for what it does let's look under the hood by creating the same data container using some mid-level APIs Creating data containers from files Before we recreate the data container we'll download the dataset and get the path where the files are saved to Now we'll start with  loadfolderdata  which creates a data container here a  Vector  of files given a path We'll use the path of the downloaded dataset files  is a data container where each observation is a path to a file We'll confirm that using  getobs  Next we need to load an image and the corresponding class from the path If you have a look at the folder structure of  dir  you can see that the parent folder of each file gives the name of class So we can use the following function to load the  image class  pair from a path Finally we use  mapobs  to lazily transform each observation and have a data container ready to be used for training an image classifier Exercises Using  mapobs  and  loadfile  create a data container where every observation is only an image Change the above code to run on a different dataset from the list in  Datasets.DATASETS_IMAGECLASSIFICATION  Splitting a data container into subsets Until now we've only created a single data container containing all observations in a dataset In practice though you'll want to have at least a training and validation split The easiest way to get these is to randomly split your data container into two parts Here we split  data  into 80 training and 20 validation data Note the use of  shuffleobs  to make sure each split has approximately the same class distribution This is great for experimenting but where possible you will want to use the official training/validation split for a dataset Consider the image classification dataset folder structure As you can see the grandparent folder of each image indicates which split it is a part of  groupobs  allows us to partition a data container using a function Let's use it to split  filedata  based on the name of the grandparent directory We can't reuse  data  for this since it no longer carries the file information Using this official split it will be easier to compare the performance of your results with those of others Dataset recipes We saw above how different image classification datasets can be loaded with the same logic as long as they are in a common format To encapsulate the logic for loading common dataset formats FastAI.jl has  DatasetRecipe s When we used  datarecipes  in the  discovery tutorial  it showed us such recipes that allow loading a dataset for a specific task For example  imagenette2-160  has an associated  ImageFolders  recipe which we can load by getting the entry and calling  load  on it These recipes also take care of loading the data block information for the dataset Read the  discovery tutorial  to find out more about that"},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/FastAI.Textual.replace_all_caps","title":"replace_all_caps","text":""},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/FastAI.Datasets.obsslice","title":"obsslice","text":""},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/Flux.OneHotLike","title":"OneHotLike","text":""},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/FastAI.PropagateAlways","title":"PropagateAlways","text":""},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/FluxTraining.runchecks","title":"runchecks","text":""},{"doctype":"documentation","id":"references/FastAI.Vision.Models.runtests","title":"runtests","text":"Equivalent
