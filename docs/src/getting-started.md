# Getting Started

If you are familiar with fastai in Python, then this package should be familiar to you. Otherwise, this documentation should answer most of your questions. If you find a question unanswered, you can use the [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org), [Zulip group](https://julialang.zulipchat.com/register/), or [Slack group](https://julialang.org/slack/) to get an answer (the `#machine-learning` channels will be of interest). If appropriate, please file an issue on Github so that we can improve our documentation!

## Installation

This package is currently unregistered, since it is still in development and unstable. To install it, run the following in the Julia REPL (note pressing `]` enters Pkg-mode):
```
] add https://github.com/FluxML/FastAI.jl
```

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues and need to troubleshoot, please file an issue or post in the [Julia Zulip](https://julialang.zulipchat.com/register/) under the [`#ml-ecosystem-coordination` stream](https://julialang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/237432-ml-ecosystem-coordination).
